## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches novice programmers to write modular code to perform data analysis
using Python. The emphasis, however, is on teaching language-agnostic principles of
programming such as automation with loops and encapsulation with functions,
see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-practices] to learn more.

The example used in this lesson analyses some model-generated waveheight data. Learners are shown
how it is better to automate analysis using functions instead of repeating analysis
steps manually.

The rendered version of the lesson is available at:
<https://noc-oi.github.io/python-novice-esces/>.

This lesson is derived from the [Analaysis of Inflammation Data lesson](inflammation_lesson). [Neil Chue Hong](npch), [Chris Wood](chris_wood), [Lucy Bricheno](lucy_b), and [Daniel Barker](daniel_b) were awarded a [NERC Advanced Short Training Course Grant](nerc_grant) to run Software Carpentry Courses specifically for
NERC domain scientists, to include providing domain-specific examples. The wave-height data was taken from. Bricheno & Wolf (2018) 'Future wave conditions of Europe, in response to high‐end climate change scenarios.' Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.
