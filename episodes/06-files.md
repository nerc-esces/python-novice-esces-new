::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  questions

- "How can I do the same operations on many different files?"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- "Use a library function to get a list of filenames that match a wildcard pattern."
- "Write a `for` loop to process multiple files."

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


When working with real datasets, we may not always have everything in a single file.
We need a way to get a list of all the files in our `data` directory whose names start with `wave_` and end with `.csv`.
The following library will help us to achieve this:
```python
import glob
```


The `glob` library contains a function, also called `glob`,
that finds files and directories whose names match a pattern.
We provide those patterns as strings:
the character `*` matches zero or more characters,
while `?` matches any one character.
We can use this to get the names of all the CSV files in the current directory:

```python
print(glob.glob('waves_*.csv'))
```


```output
['waves_10s.csv', 'waves_00s.csv', 'waves_80s.csv', 'waves_90s.csv']
```


These files show waveheight data from some years in the decades indicated in the filename. As this example shows,
`glob.glob`'s result is a list of files in arbitrary order.
This means we can loop over it
to do something with each filename in turn.
In our case,
the "something" we want to do is generate a set of plots for each file in our waveheight dataset.

If we want to start by analyzing just the first three files in alphabetical order, we can use the
`sorted` built-in function to generate a new sorted list from the `glob.glob` output:

```python
import glob
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filenames = sorted(glob.glob('waves_*.csv'))
filenames = filenames[0:3]

for filename in filenames:
    print(filename)

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')
    number_of_rows = data.shape[0]
    number_of_years = number_of_rows//12

    # need to reshape the data for plotting
    data = numpy.reshape(data[:,2], [number_of_years,12])

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```


```output
waves_00.csv
```


![](fig/waves_loop_1.svg){alt="Output from the first iteration of the for loop. Three line graphs showing the average,

```output
waves_10s.csv
```

```output
waves_80s.csv
```


![](fig/waves_loop_3.svg){alt="Output from the third iteration of the for loop. Three line graphs showing the average,
maximum and minimum waveheight in the 1980s."}


Looking at these three decades, we can see similarities - with the average value representing a smooth climate with clear annual cycle.
There are differences year on year, and the minimum and maximum data tend to be more variable than the mean.

## Different types of division

You might have noticed that we calculated the number of years when reshaping the data, rather
than using 10 years for each decade. This was useful here because the file containing data from the 2010s
only has data from 6 years, but each one of these years did contain data for every month. If any year had missing data
from any month, we would have needed to have done some additional preprocessing.

When we divided by 12 to get the number of years, we used `//` - you might have expected us just to use `/`.
Python creates a float as a result from a division operation using `/`, even if both inputs are integers:

```python
type(10/2)
```


```output
float
```


However, if you use a float value as an array index, you get an error (even if it refers to a whole number).
`//` is Python's integer division operator - meaning that the result will always be an integer:

```python
type(10//2)
```


```output
int
```


If the result would normally result in a floating-point number, the actual result will instead be an integer rounded towards minus infinity:

```python
print(19/4)
print(19//4)
```


```output
4.75
4
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Sometimes, plots can help us spot patterns in data, or problems with data.

Let's load `waves_90s.csv` and reshape it so that the 3rd column (the average signifncant wave height for each month) is converted into 12 columns for each year.

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname = "waves_90s.csv", delimiter=',')
reshaped_data = numpy.reshape(data[:,2], [10,12])
print(data.shape)
print(reshaped_data.shape)
```


```output
(120, 3)
(10, 12)
```


If we try and take the mean for the entire year, we'll see that there must be NaNs:

```python
numpy.mean(reshaped_data)
```


```output
np.float64(nan)
```


If we plot the reshaped data, we would see white squares where there are NaNs in the data.
Let's do the shaping operation again but this time in a more generic way where we don't need to know how many years are represented in the dataset.

```python
number_of_rows = data.shape[0]
# assume that every 12 rows represents one year of data and there's no missing data
number_of_years = number_of_rows//12
data = numpy.reshape(data[:,2], [number_of_years,12])
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
```


![](fig/1990s_nans.svg){alt="1990s data highlighting NaNs"}

We can clearly see that there must have been some problem with the collection of data in the first 6 months of 1994.
Apart from that, the rest of the data looks relatively sensible, with low wave heights in the summer months of the decade, and
higher wave heights in the winter months of the decade. This means that we have no reason not to trust the rest of the dataset.

There are other ways that we could have determined where the missing data is. The Numpy function `isnan` will tell us whether
any given value is NaN; if we give it an `ndarray`, it will return an `ndarray` of the same shape with boolean values (`True` or `False`)
showing if the value at that index was a NaN. `argwhere` will return the indices for an `ndarray` of booleans where the value is `True`.

```python
numpy.argwhere(numpy.isnan(data))
```


```output
array([[4, 0],
       [4, 1],
       [4, 2],
       [4, 3],
       [4, 4],
       [4, 5]])
```


There are almost always multiple ways to achieve the same result in programming, and often the choice as to which method
to use comes down to personal preference. Some people might prefer to look at patterns in plots, while others may be happy to
look at summary statistics and aggregate values from tabular data to come to the same conclusion.

## Plotting Differences

Plot the difference between the average monthly waveheights in the 1980s and 1990s.
Can you do this using glob, without specifying the filenames explicitly in the code?

:::::::::::::::  solution
```python
import glob
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filenames = sorted(glob.glob('waves_*.csv'))

data0 = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filenames[2], delimiter=',')
data1 = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filenames[3], delimiter=',')

number_of_rows0 = data0.shape[0]
number_of_years0 = number_of_rows0//12
data0 = numpy.reshape(data0[:,2], [number_of_years0,12])

number_of_rows1 = data1.shape[0]
number_of_years1 = number_of_rows1//12
data1 = numpy.reshape(data1[:,2], [number_of_years1,12])

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

plt.ylabel('Difference in average')
plt.plot(numpy.mean(data0, axis=0) - numpy.mean(data1, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Congratulations! We've investigated the wave data and spotted some trends, and identified bad / missing data.
Now that we understand what is in the model data set, and trust that it is realistic, we can use it to make practical decisions about things like boat operations


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- "Use `glob.glob(pattern)` to create a list of files whose names match a pattern."
- "Use `*` in a pattern to match zero or more characters, and `?` to match any single character."
